Neural Network Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is utilized to find trading opportunities in the stock market. It is based on information such as price movement, volume, and historical patterns. This project will take advantage of the neural networks ability to identify patternsâ€”and recognize potential trading opportunties based on technical analysis. 

Instead of having a human read charts, the neural network will be trained to recognize charts and recognize patterns. It will return to the user what % resemblance a stock pattern has to a technical pattern it has trained on. In this way, it acts as a copilot for a daytrader. 

To be clear, we are not trying to predict stock prices. There are too many factors to consider. Rather, this will be a pattern-matching application. 

Ideally, this project will result in a functional app that can be connected to a stock market API and return results in realtime. A bonus would be for this neural network to automate trades. 

This will be exciting for two reasons. First, it can help test the effectiveness of tehnical analysis, as a lot of people do not believe in it. Two, it has the potential to make money!

Goals
1. Students will learn how to clean/prepare datasets (which I hypothesize will be hard)
2. Train and deploy a neural network that can detect technical patterns 
3. Students gain a basic understanding of daytrading and technical analysis trading on price momentum
