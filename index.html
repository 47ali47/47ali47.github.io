        <h1>Neural Network Technical Analysis</h1>
        <p>Technical analysis is utilized to find trading opportunities in the stock market. It is based on information such as price movement, volume, and historical patterns.</p>
        
        <p>This project will take advantage of the neural network's ability to identify patterns and recognize potential trading opportunities based on technical analysis.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Instead of having a human read charts, the neural network will be trained to recognize patterns in stock price charts. It will return to the user a percentage resemblance of a stock pattern to a trained technical pattern, acting as a copilot for a day trader.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a pattern-matching application, not a price prediction tool.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Students will learn how to clean and prepare datasets.</li>
            <li>Train and deploy a neural network to detect technical patterns.</li>
            <li>Gain an understanding of day trading and technical analysis.</li>
        </ul>
